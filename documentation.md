# Project 1 
For project 1, Cameron, Kevin, and I met up in a discord voice chat, and using Visual Studio Code's live share extension we deliberated over how we would solve the problems. We didn't use any outside resources to help with the project other than the Wikipedia page of the [Vigenere cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen√®re_cipher).

# Project 2
For project 2, we took the same approach to doing the project, and the resources we used were [Breaking a transposition cipher paper](https://homepages.math.uic.edu/~leon/mcs425-s08/handouts/breaking_tranposition_cipher.pdf), [English Letter Frequency Count](https://norvig.com/mayzner.html), and [Columnar Transposition Cryptoanalysis](https://websites.nku.edu/~christensen/1901cscmat483%20Section%2011%20columnar%20transpotion%20cryptanalysis.pdf)
